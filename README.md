This problem was given to me by my friend. This friend is a dungeon master, who created a fantasy world for dungeons and dragons. This fantasy world has three moons named Annu, Oki, and Tarro. Each of these moons has a different moon cycle. Annu has a cycle that is 19.5 days long that is from new moon to new moon this cycle is shifted to start 3 days after creation, from now on this will be described as a 19.5 shift 3 cycle. Oki has a 45.5 shift 6 cycle.
Tarro has a 72.3 shift 25 cycle. He wanted to know when all three moons were full within the same day so that he could have a festival at those times.
